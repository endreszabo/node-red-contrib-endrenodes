# What is this repo?

In this repo you can find my contribution nodes (plugins) for the Internet-of-things wiring tool called [Node-RED](http://nodered.org/). With my extra nodes you can extend the available Node-RED interfaces.

They will probably contain some bugs as I am not a pro Node coder (and I am not a coder at all).

## notification

This node uses Linux-specific dbus messaging bus to show up notifications to the currently signed in user running Node-RED in the background. This comes handy for personal assistant applications.
